/**
 * Given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, was assigned a unique number from 1 to n
 * based on their creation sequence. This means that the object with sequence number 3 was created just
 * before the object with sequence number 4.
 *
 * Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n) and without
 * any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed an integer array containing only
 * the sequence numbers, though each number is actually an object.
 *
 * Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 *
 * Input: [2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 *
 * Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
