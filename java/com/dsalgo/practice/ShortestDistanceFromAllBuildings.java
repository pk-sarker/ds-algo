/**
 * You are given an m x n grid grid of values 0, 1, or 2, where:
 *
 * each 0 marks an empty land that you can pass by freely,
 * each 1 marks a building that you cannot pass through, and
 * each 2 marks an obstacle that you cannot pass through.
 * You want to build a house on an empty land that reaches all buildings in the shortest total travel distance.
 * You can only move up, down, left, and right.
 *
 * Return the shortest travel distance for such a house. If it is not possible to build such a house according to
 * the above rules, return -1.
 *
 * The total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses of the friends and the meeting point.
 *
 * The distance is calculated using Manhattan Distance, where distance(p1, p2) = |p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|.
 *
 * Input: grid = [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2).
 * The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal.
 * So return 7.
 *
 * - BFS each 1 to find out min distance to each 0,
 *      - accumulate this distances to each 0 location: distance[][],
 *      - finally find out min value from distance[][]
 * - In the case of cannot find a house to each all house:
 *     - not all 0s can reach each house: reachCount[][] to count the # of house each 0 can reach,
 *          only >= houseCount valid
 *     - [~~improve speed~~]ï¼šnot all house can reach each house, in this case, we cannot build such house,
 *         -count reachable house #, if < houseCount, return -1 directly!!!!!
