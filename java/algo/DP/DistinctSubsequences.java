/**
 * Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.
 *
 * A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none)
 * of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions.
 * (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
 *
 * It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation:
 * As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
 * rabbbit
 * rabbbit
 * rabbbit
 *
 * Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 * babgbag
 *
 * Solution:
 * We have two pointere, each pointing to current character in both strings.
 *
 * There will be two scenerio:
 * 1) if character at position j in t matches i th character in s.
 *      Now we can do two things, move ahead both pointers and continue
 *      or We can move the pointer at s and continue
 *      func(i, j) = func(i + 1, j) + func(i + 1, j + 1)
 *
 * 2) if character at current position doesn't match
 *      Wee have no option otherthen moving s pointer

     * 1) Initialize a 2D array dp of size MÃ—N where M represents the length of string S while N represents
     * the length of string T.
     * 2) An important thing to remember here is what recurseDP(i, j) actually represents. It basically
     * represents the number of distinct subsequences in string s[i....M] that equals the string t[j...N].
     * This is important because we will have our iterative loops based on this idea itself. This implies
     * that we will first calculate the value of recurseDP(i, j) before we can find answers for recurseDP(i - 1, j)
     * or recurseDP(i, j - 1) or recurseDP(i - 1, j - 1).
     * 3) Based on this idea, we will have an outer loop for the index i which will go from M - 1 to 0 and
     * an inner loop for j from N - 1 to 0.
     * 4) We first handle our recursion's base case in outside of our nested loop and here we initialize the last column and the last row of our dp table.
     *      - dp[M][j] represents that we have an empty substring left in String S while we still have T[j...N-1] left.
     *          That means there is no possibility of match, so dp[M][j] = 0
     *      - dp[i][N] represents that we have matched all the letter in T, and now at empty string, so dp[i][N] = 1
     *
     * 5) After that, we simply set dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]. Remember that there was one recursive call that
     *  we need to make irrespective of whether there is a character match or not?
     *
     * 6) Then we check if the characters s[i] and t[j] match or not. If they do, then we add dp[i + 1][j + 1] to dp[i][j].
     *  In the recursion based solution, we were caching this value in the dictionary. Here, the dictionary is replaced by the dp array.
